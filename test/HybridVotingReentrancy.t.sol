    /**
     * CEI ordering property tests for HybridVoting.vote().
     *
     * Background: HybridVotingCore.vote() calls IERC20(cls.asset).balanceOf(voter)
     * inside _calculateClassPower. cls.asset is configured via the executor-only
     * `setClasses`, so direct injection of a malicious asset requires a passed
     * governance proposal. The PR moves p.hasVoted[voter] = true to BEFORE that
     * external call (Checks-Effects-Interactions ordering).
     *
     * The originally-cited attack — a malicious ERC20 whose balanceOf() re-enters
     * vote() before hasVoted is set — is NOT exploitable today. Solidity emits
     * STATICCALL when invoking a `view` function through IERC20, and the EVM
     * enforces no-state-modification on the entire static-call subtree. The
     * recursive vote() would revert because vote() writes storage.
     *
     * The CEI ordering remains correct hygiene for two reasons:
     *   1. Forward-defense against future class strategies that might call a
     *      non-view function on cls.asset (e.g. a "lock balance during vote"
     *      pattern). Such a strategy would not run under STATICCALL and could
     *      re-enter without the EVM blocking it.
     *   2. Independent of any attack: the standard CEI pattern makes the
     *      function's pre/post-conditions easier to reason about — by the time
     *      any external code is invoked, all internal state updates from this
     *      call are visible.
     *
     * This test file pins two observable properties guaranteed by the CEI
     * ordering. We do NOT attempt to simulate the originally-cited attack,
     * because the EVM physically prevents it under current Solidity.
